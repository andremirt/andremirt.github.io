Congratulations <a href="http://www.lct.jussieu.fr/pagesperso/savin/">Andreas Savin</a> and joyful retirement! Hopefully you will be around in our community for many more years to share with us your original view on DFT. I learned a lot from you already. Here some impressions from the <a href="https://wiki.lct.jussieu.fr/workshop/index.php/Workshop_on_%22Advances_in_electronic_structure_theory%22">workshop on "Advances in electronic structure theory"</a> that was organized in honor of Andreas Savin.
