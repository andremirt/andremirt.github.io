Our recent publication in <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.033006">Physical Review Letters is now highlighted as editor's suggestion.</a> In this paper we demonstarate the genuine universality of strictly correlated electrons (SCE) formalism by applying the SCE functional to fermionic and bosonic systems with dipolar interaction. Hence, the SCE functional is now called <em>strictly correlated particles</em> (SCP) functional to express this universality.<br>
